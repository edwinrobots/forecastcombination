#Python script to set physical constants - taking those used in UM documentation Paper 5 "Notation, physical constants, units and variable names" at http://cms.ncas.ac.uk/index.php/um-documentation/met-office-documents/1494-met-office-docs
#To use in a script, do "from set_physical_constants import *"

a=6.371229e6  #Earth radius
om=7.292116e-5  #angular velocity of Earth's rotation 
R=287.05  #specific gas constant
kappa=0.285622  #R/specific heat capacity at constant pressure = 287.05/1005
g=9.80665  #acceleration due to gravity
cp=1005  #spec heat of dry air at constant pressure in J/kg/K
